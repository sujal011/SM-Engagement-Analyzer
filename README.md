# Social Media Insights Workflow with LangFlow

This project demonstrates a LangFlow-based workflow for generating meaningful insights about social media post performance. The workflow integrates Astra DB for data retrieval and GROQ AI for insightful analysis, providing actionable recommendations based on user-selected post types.

## Overview

The workflow is designed to:
1. Allow users to input a social media post type (e.g., Reels, Static Images).
2. Fetch engagement data for the selected post type and overall averages from Astra DB.
3. Analyze the data using GROQ AI with a pre-configured prompt to generate insights.
4. Display actionable recommendations via a Chat Output.
